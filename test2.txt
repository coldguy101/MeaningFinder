Octopus
Octopuses are extremely intelligent. They learn
new things just like humans. They’ve even learned a few
tricks to get them out of sticky situations. 
Octopuses hide themselves in the sand on the bottom of the ocean floor. How you ask? Well, the
octopus is like a chameleon because it can change the color of its skin to match the sand.
Some octopuses stay in more shallow water where there are rocks and coral.
An octopus uses a part of its body called a siphon
to shoot ink into the water. The ink forms a cloud that hides the octopus. By the time the ink
clears and the predator can see again, the octopus has swum away. It’s very much
like a magician doing a vanishing act.
