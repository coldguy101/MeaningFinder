Rover
One day Ann and Frank went to the lake with Rover. Rover can swim well, so Frank made him go into the water after a stick.
"Jump, Rover! Jump in and get the stick," said Frank, and into the water Rover went with a big splash. Pretty soon he came out with the stick in his mouth.
Rover did not like the game as much as Frank because the water was a little cold.
On the way home, Rover saw a rabbit and away he went after it as fast as he could go.
